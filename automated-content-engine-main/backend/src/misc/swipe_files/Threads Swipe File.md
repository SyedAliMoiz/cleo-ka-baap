Thread 1 - paperclip

This guy exposed a loophole in the US economy.

After years of being too broke to buy a home...

He traded a single red paperclip for a $50,000 house.

All he did was discover this powerful truth about wealth:

-

Kyle MacDonald (a broke 26-year-old) had 1 bold goal:

Trade a $0.01 clip to a $50,000 house in a year – this was 2005.

No money allowed. Just trades.

It sounds ridiculous. And it kind of is.

But since Kyle, countless others have attempted a similar challenge 📹:

-

Kyle was inspired by a game called "Bigger and Better," where kids trade small items for progressively larger ones.

Kyle wondered: Could this work in real life?

So on July 14, 2005, he posted a picture of his red paperclip on Craigslist, asking for something "bigger or better."

-

Trade 1?
Paperclip → Fish-shaped pen
Why? Two Vancouver women wanted to be part of history.
Value: $0.01 → $10

Trade 2? Pen → Hand-sculpted doorknob
A Seattle artist saw the pen as a unique collectible.
Value: $10 → $50

Looks like one man's junk is another's treasure.

-

Kyle's early trades snowballed:
Doorknob → Coleman stove → Honda generator

Each swap found someone who valued his item more than their own.

The generator (worth $1000) was Kyle's first four-figure score.

But it wasn't all linear...

-

Kyle traded his $1000 generator for... a neon sign and an empty keg?

Sounds crazy, but here's the genius:

This "Instant Party" kit was a viral story waiting to happen.

Kyle realized: He wasn't trading objects. He was trading ATTENTION.

And the attention was priceless: 

-

Kyle's Project Caught Fire

Local news, then national media.

The trades got wilder:
• Snowmobile → Trip to Yahk, BC
• Trip → Box truck
• Truck → Recording contract
• Contract → Year's rent in Phoenix

He was no longer trading goods – OR attention. He was trading fame.

-

The game-changer: Kyle traded a year's rent for an afternoon with Alice Cooper.

Then swapped that for a KISS motorized snow globe.

Enter Corbin Bernsen: Hollywood actor and snow globe collector.

He offered Kyle a movie role for the globe.

There's a superfan for everything. 

-

Kyle's masterstroke: He finds a town that wants fame more than real estate.

Kipling, Saskatchewan trades a two-story farmhouse for the movie role.

They get film fame. Kyle gets a home. Win-win.

The best trades create value for both sides.

-

July 12, 2006: One year after he started, Kyle moves into his new home.

14 trades.
10 countries.
$0.01 → $50,000

Kyle had done the impossible. But he'd also rediscovered a lost art: 

-

Bartering

The direct exchange of goods or services without money is as old as human civilization.

But in our cash-driven world, we've largely forgotten its power.

Kyle's story reminds us that with creativity and persistence, bartering can create value from virtually nothing. 

-

The genius of bartering lies in subjective value.

A paperclip might be worth a penny to you, but to someone else, it might be the missing piece in a million-dollar deal.

Other people have tried to copy Kyle's approach...

-

In a world obsessed with monetary value, bartering reintroduces human connection into transactions.

It's not just about the item; it's about the story, the experience, the relationship.

This "relationship value" can far exceed the item's monetary worth. 

-

Why is a single Bitcoin valued at $60,000?

It's not tangible. You can't hold it.

Yet it represents a revolution in finance, a hedge against inflation, and a bet on the future.

Value isn't always visible. Sometimes, it's an idea. 

-

Kyle didn't just trade up to a house. He traded up to a new life.

A book deal. A speaking career. A story that inspired millions.

All from a paperclip and a wild idea.

What's your red paperclip? And how will you trade it?

thread 2 - winklevoss

Mark Zuckerberg stole Facebook from them.

So they sued him for $65 million.

Now they're crypto billionaires.

6 lessons from the wild story of the Winklevoss twins:

-

Let's start with betrayal.

In 2004, two Harvard twins had an idea for a social network and hired a coding genius named Mark Zuckerberg to build it.

Months later, Facebook launched. But there's a problem - the twins weren't part of it.

Furious, they sue Zuckerberg. Meanwhile: 

-

Facebook has exploded in popularity.

In 2008 (after a 4-year lawsuit), the twins settled for $65 million - $20 million cash and $45 million in Facebook stock.

Most would've walked away. But the Winklevosses? They were just getting started...

Here's where it gets interesting: 
-

The twins held onto that Facebook stock.

Despite feeling wronged, they believed in the company's potential. And it was a good call:

By Facebook's 2012 IPO, their $45 million in stock grew to $200 million.

Their "enemy's" success became their windfall. But it doesn't stop here: 

-

Fast-forward to Summer 2013.

The twins heard about Bitcoin. Price at the time? Just $8 per coin.

Intrigued, they spent months researching – and they concluded:

This would be bigger than Facebook.

So they made a bold move that left everyone stunned... 

-

They bought 1% of ALL Bitcoin in circulation.

Cost: $11 million Amount: 120,000 BTC

People called them crazy. "Magic internet money," they scoffed.

But their bet wasn't on currency. It was on a financial revolution...

-

To them, Bitcoin was:

• Limited in supply (only 21 million ever)
• Decentralized (no government control)
• Borderless (send money anywhere, instantly)

They believed it could transform finance. But owning Bitcoin wasn't enough:

-

The crypto world in 2015 was like the Wild West - risky and unregulated.

The twins saw an opportunity.

So they launched Gemini, a regulated crypto exchange – think of it like a stock exchange but for digital currencies.

Here's how it worked: 

-

Gemini brought trust to the crypto world.

It followed the rules, insured deposits, and kept everything secure.

The twins became Bitcoin's biggest fans, speaking at events & teaching people about it.

Why? More people using Bitcoin = rising value. Here are the numbers:

-

By 2017, Bitcoin's price hit $20,000.

-Remember their $11 million investment? It was now worth $1.3 billion.

But they didn't cash out. Instead, they invested even MORE in the crypto world, expanding globally & pushing for crypto adoption.

This long-term thinking paid off:

-

2020 hit. COVID spread. Governments printed trillions of dollars.

Suddenly, people started seeing Bitcoin as "digital gold" - a way to protect wealth when times are uncertain. By 2021, Bitcoin soared past $60,000.

The twins' crypto empire was now worth billions.

-

Today, they're still working to make crypto mainstream:

• Making Gemini easier to use
• Pushing for clear crypto laws
• Investing in the next big blockchain ideas

But the Winklevoss story isn't just about crypto. It's a masterclass in turning setbacks into opportunities:

-

Use rejection as a redirector.

Facebook's door closed, but it opened a window to a billion-dollar crypto future. Sometimes, your rival's success can fuel your own.

Holding onto that Facebook stock? Genius move.

The key takeaways:

-

Spot trends early, then go all-in. The twins didn't just buy Bitcoin; they built an entire ecosystem around it.

Always think long-term, reinvesting into a bigger vision.

Educate your market. By teaching others about crypto, the twins grew the industry - and their influence... 

-

Stay curious about emerging trends. It could be the next goldmine.

Don't let "no" stop you. Let it fuel you.

Remember: today's setback might redirect you to tomorrow's billion-dollar idea.

What will be your $65 million revenge story?

Thread 3 - reynolds

Ryan Reynolds made $50 Million for playing Deadpool.

But that's pennies compared to his business ventures:

• F1 Team
• Soccer Club
• Alcohol brand
• Mobile network operator
…and others are worth close to $14BN.

Here’s how he does it (and his most crazy ads):

-

Deadpool's back, and he's breaking more than the 4th wall.

"Deadpool & Wolverine" is on track to be 2024's highest-grossing film.

Deadpool went from B-list superhero to box office gold — how'd Reynolds do it? 

-

By turning marketing into an art form.

Remember when Deadpool hijacked Hugh Jackman's birthday message?

Or created a Tinder profile?

That's the Reynolds touch:

"If you want to be recognized tomorrow. We need something outrageous." 

-

He pitched comparing Deadpool to the Avengers & X-Men.

The studio nearly had a heart attack.

But Reynolds was right. Outrageous sells.

The result?

-

• First Deadpool: $783M on a $58M budget
• Deadpool 2: $785M
• Deadpool & Wolverine: Already $900M

But here's the kicker:

Reynolds' business empire makes his Deadpool earnings look like unimpressive.

How? Let's break it down...

-

It all started with gin.

In 2018, Ryan tasted Aviation Gin and fell in love.

He didn't just buy a stake – he became the face AND creative director.

His first ad? A hilarious "process" video that went viral instantly. 

-

Ryan's philosophy is simple:

"I have to have an authentic connection with something. Otherwise, the audience will know."

This authenticity shines through in every ad he makes.

Like this "merger" announcement with Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic: 

-

But Ryan's not just about laughs.

He's a master of seizing cultural moments.

Remember Peloton's controversial 2019 ad?

Within days, Ryan dropped "The Gift That Doesn't Give Back" for Aviation Gin, featuring the same actress.
It's marketing gold: 

-

Ryan's next big win?

Mint Mobile.

He bought a 25% stake in 2020, and their subscriber growth jumped 34% overnight.

His strategy? Hilariously self-aware ads like this:

"At Mint Mobile, we don't hate you." 

-

In 2022, Ryan pivoted to sports.

He and Rob McElhenney bought Wrexham AFC for $2.5M.

Why a small Welsh soccer club?

Ryan saw untapped potential and a great story.

The result? A hugely popular documentary series and promotion to a higher league.

-

But Ryan wasn't done with sports.

In 2022, he dropped $218M for a 24% stake in Alpine F1 racing team.

Why F1?

It's the fastest-growing sports league globally, with 1.54B viewers in 2022.

That's 15x the Super Bowl audience!

-

Even in tech, Ryan's marketing magic shines.

He invested in 1Password and immediately starred in their ad campaign...

So what can you take away? 

-

Your personality is your competitive advantage.

The brand value Ryan's added just from his ads is in the millions.

That's the Gen Z secret: Authenticity.

But unlike Ryan:

-

You don't need to be a celebrity to build a killer personal brand.

That's the great thing about authenticity — anyone can make use of it.

So start today: Create content. Be authentic online.

And once you do, you'll attract opportunities just like Ryan does.

-

And like Ryan:

You'll benefit from a content flywheel.

Your business will give you content. Your content will give you business.

Compounding growth.

Thread 4 - reid hoffmann 9-5 dying

Your 9-to-5 job is dying.

By 2034, it'll be extinct.

That's Reid Hoffman's latest prediction – the founder of LinkedIn who predicted the rise of social media in 1997.

Here's what he said next:

-

Hoffman's past predictions are spooky:

• Predicted social networks would change the world (LinkedIn sold for $26B)
• Saw the sharing economy coming (Early Airbnb investor)
• Called the AI revolution years before ChatGPT

So we should probably listen to his latest prediction: 

-

The Gig Economy Revolution is coming, and it's bigger than you think.

Within a decade, 50% of the US population will be freelancers.

But here's the twist: They'll earn MORE than traditional employees.

Why? It all comes down to a simple equation...

-

Specialized skills + global demand = premium rates.

Platforms like Braintrust already let freelancers keep 100% of their earnings.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The real game-changer?

Your digital footprint will become your most valuable asset.

-

Forget resumes. Your online portfolio will be your new CV.

Companies will hire based on proven work, not degrees or job titles.

But here's what most people are missing:

It's not just about showcasing your work...

-

It's about building a personal brand that stands out in a sea of digital noise.

But here's the thing: standing out is getting harder every day.

Why? Because AI is entering the chat.

Everyone's freaking out about AI stealing jobs. But they're missing the bigger picture:

-

For example, lawyers using AI are already 200% more efficient.

Instead, they focus on high-level strategy and client relationships.

AI is changing existing jobs. But it's also creating entirely new ones.

Ever heard of an AI Ethicist? Well, you're about to...

-

AI Ethicists tackle questions like:

• How do we ensure AI decisions are fair and unbiased?
• What happens when AI makes life-or-death choices?
• How do we protect privacy in an AI-driven world?

It's tech meets philosophy.

But the most valuable skill in the AI age?

-

It's knowing how to leverage AI tools effectively.

Why? Because those who master AI collaboration will outperform their peers.

It's not about competing with AI but about becoming an AI-enhanced superhuman in your field.

Now, let's talk about where you'll be working in 2034:

-

Spoiler alert: It's probably not in a traditional office.

The Death of the HQ is coming, and it's happening faster than you think:

Office space costs will plummet 40% by 2034.

GitLab, with 1,500+ employees in 65+ countries, has NO physical office.

But here's the real kicker:

-

The future of work isn't just remote. It's hyper-local AND global simultaneously.

Enter the 15-minute city concept.

Live, work, and play – all within a short walk or bike ride.

Sounds utopian, right? But wait till you hear about the Micro-Entrepreneurship Boom...

-

By 2034, 1 in 3 professionals will have multiple micro-businesses.

The passion economy will create unlikely millionaires:

• A forager earning $200K/year selling wild mushrooms
• A Minecraft architect making $350K designing virtual worlds

But the biggest opportunity?

-

It's YOU.

The future of work isn't just flexible. It's fluid.

You'll seamlessly shift between employee, freelancer, entrepreneur, and investor.

All in a single week.

But the million-dollar question remains...

-

Are you ready to seize this unprecedented opportunity for freedom and wealth creation?

The future favors the adaptable.

The extinction of 9-5 jobs isn't a threat. It's your chance to redefine success.

So, what's your next move?

Thread 5 - CIA prank

The CIA is the top intelligence organization in the world.

But in 2015, ONE prank call from a 15 y.o kid in his bedroom almost made them trigger a global cyber war.

Here's how...🧵

-

Meet Cracka.

At 15, he was already a seasoned hacker.

His biggest hack? Wiping out millions in student debt from a medical school's servers with one click.

What a legend!

-

Cracka's partner was "Default," a teen from Virginia.

Before joining Cracka, default was on a global mission: banning bestiality in Denmark.

-

They exposed the country's underground "dog brothels," sparking outrage until Denmark finally outlawed the practice in 2015.

Anonsec's triumph was credited to Anonymous. But bigger targets awaited.

-

They teamed up to form CWA.

Their aim? Expose the secrets and hypocrisy of top US officials.

Target #1: CIA Director John Brennan. Cracka breached his email with a simple Google search.

-

Once inside Brennan's AOL account, Cracka:

• Prank-called his family
• Rerouted calls to pro-Palestine groups
• Leaked sensitive CIA files to Wikileaks

This cost $16 million and humiliated the CIA's reputation.

But CWA was just getting started.

Watch this:

-

CWA's hit list expanded to include:

• 20,000 FBI agents
• The entire US prisoner database
• 9,000 Department of Justice officials

Sensitive documents, agent info, even CIA torture reports - all leaked online.

These kids are about to outplay the US intelligence community with PhDs and decades of experience.

-

But CWA poked the bear one too many times.

In late 2015, the FBI and UK police launched coordinated raids.

Official seized Default's computers and his secret stash of 1,000 Bitcoin, worth $40 million today.

-

Cracka, still a minor at 15, got 2 years in a UK juvenile detention center.

Default got the meltdown from the US law:

• 5 years in federal prison
• Solitary confinement
• $145,000 in fines

"I thought I was doing right," he said later. "But I was completely wrong."

-

Today, Cracka keeps a low profile, hoping for a legal cybersecurity career. Default reflects on his mistakes.

The hacks exposed the fragility of even the most powerful agencies.

But like they say, the house always wins. 

-

Years later, mass surveillance has only grown.

Under Biden, a controversial spy program has been renewed to monitor:

• Jan 6 rioters
• BLM protesters
• Campaign donors

No warrants are needed. Snowden's revelations have faded. The watchmen remain unwatched. 

-

What do you think of this thread?

When does principled lawbreaking cross a line?

Can (and should) individuals take on the system without being crushed?

Thread 6 - marc andreesen

By 2034, your 9-5 job will be extinct.

Everything will be so cheap you won't have to work anymore.

That's Marc Andreessen's latest prediction — the billionaire investor who predicted the rise of the internet in 1993.

Here's what he said next:

-

Marc Andreessen's work is legendary.

He created the world's first widely used web browser — decades before most of us were born.

The internet today wouldn't be the same without him.

And since then?

He's predicted all the trends that shape our world today:

-

• He's been all-in on AI years before ChatGPT
• Foresaw the sharing economy & backed Lyft/AirBnB
• Knew social media would take off & invested in Facebook

He's a man who writes the future.

And this is his alarming prediction:

-

Andreessen predicts AI will make many things 1000x cheaper.

Legal briefs, medical diagnoses, management consulting...

Will cost PENNIES compared to thousands of dollars now.

Think about the impact this will have on your life:

-

If everything's cheaper, you can spend the money you save on all the other parts of your life.

And if things that cost $1,000s before become dirt cheap...

The amount you need to work could fall drastically.

Let's take any context where we rely on another human:

-

You can train an AI to be whoever you need it to be by inputting just a few bits of info.

Marc Andreessen thinks AI will make:

• Assistants
• Teachers
• Coaches

Available to everyone. But with all the extra time + technology, there's an even bigger shift for society:

-

EVERYONE will be a creator.

With tools like Dall-E, ChatGPT and Claude, barriers to creating ANYTHING collapse.

A few quick prompts will generate entire articles, sketches & websites.

What does this mean for you?

-

The onus shifts to the idea rather than execution:

Wealth will accrue to those with the best ideas — rather than those who work the hardest.

And it's your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create the content you've always wanted to.

Marc Andreesseen notes:

-

"AI-augmented artists, musicians, writers and filmmakers gain the ability to realize their visions far faster and at greater scale than ever before."

The creator economy's just getting started — and if you're reading this, you're early.

That's why you need to take action today:

-

Marc Andreessen thinks we're still CRAZY early to the internet:

Anybody on the planet can create online.

All you need to create connections, opportunities and wealth are your thoughts and a laptop.

You're missing out If you're not.

That's where a personal brand comes in:

-

Attention is the new currency. A personal brand is your magnet.

Especially in a world of AI-generated content:

Your personality is the one competitive advantage no-one can take from you.

Thread 7 - saverin

Mark Zuckerburg stole Facebook from him.

So he sued Zuckerburg for $1.5 million.

Now he's a tech billionaire.

5 lessons from the wild story of Facebook's forgotten co-founder:

-

In 2004, Harvard student Eduardo Saverin co-founded Facebook with his friend Mark Zuckerberg.

As CFO, he provided early funding & business expertise.

But as Facebook grew, tensions rose...

-

Saverin thought Facebook should make money.

Zuckerburg thought Facebook should grow its users first.

The final straw? Saverin placed ads on Facebook without consulting Zuckerberg.

Then came the shocking twist:

-

Saverin's stake was diluted from 34% to just 0.03%.

He was pushed out of the company he helped create.

Furious, he sued Facebook.

What happened next would change the course of tech history...

-

Facebook's popularity skyrocketed.

In 2009, Saverin settled with Facebook & his stake was restored to about 5% of the company.

Most would've faded into obscurity. But Saverin? He was just getting started...

Here's where it gets interesting:

-

Saverin made a move that left Silicon Valley stunned:

He packed his bags and moved to Singapore in 2009.

Despite feeling betrayed, he saw something others didn't:

The untapped potential of Asia's tech scene...

-

He believed the combination of:

• A huge, young population
• Rapidly growing internet adoption
• Markets that hadn't been disrupted in years

Could be the next frontier of tech innovation.

-

Here are some of his early bets:

• Ninja Van (Singapore logistics) - current valuation $1B
• Meesho (Indian e-commerce) - current valuation $3.5B
• PharmEasy (Indian medicine delivery) - current valuation $5.6B

Then came 2020, and everything changed...

-

COVID hit, accelerating digital adoption worldwide.

Suddenly, Saverin's bets on e-commerce, digital health, and remote work tools looked genius.

His tech portfolio soared in value.

And today?

-

His investment company, B Capital, manages close to $7 Billion.

It's grown to success that transcends Saverin's Facebook's luck.

But his story isn't just about tech investing. There are profound lessons to take away:

-

Use setbacks as fuel for reinvention.

Getting pushed out of Facebook could have been devastating. Instead, it launched a career bringing life to a fledgling ecosystem.

Spot emerging trends early.

Today, Asia's an obvious growth opportunity.

But a decade ago?

-

It was a needle in the haystack of risky bets.

A final interesting point from Saverin:

Despite Zuckerburg's actions, Saverin wholeheartedly believes in the future of social media.

In fact, social media's still in its infancy...

-

Saverin believes we're shifting from huge platforms like Facebook into a new age.

And we're moving to community-based platforms (e.g. X).

Which means if you're reading this on X, you're early...

Now's the perfect time to build an audience and capitalize:

-

We used Facebook for fun; to pass the time.

But now, social media's being used for EVERYTHING.

Business. Shopping. Real-life interactions.

Building an audience on social media is the new way to reach your goals 10x faster.

The choice is yours...

Thread 8 - Buffett

He makes $37 million per DAY.

Has more wealth than the GDP of over 100 countries.

But still uses coupons at McDonald's and lives in a house he bought for $31,500.

The genius branding lesson (that no-one talks about) from America's richest investor:

-

First, let's talk about that house.

Buffett bought it for $31,500 in 1958 ($328,000 in today's dollars).

It's now worth about $1 million, but that's pocket change for a man worth $117 billion.

Why hasn't he upgraded?

-

Buffett's answer:

"I'm happy there. I'd move if I thought I'd be happier someplace else."

This isn't just about frugality.

It's about authenticity: A cornerstone of his brand.

And this has been consistent most of his life:

-

As his wealth grew, his lifestyle barely changed.

This consistency became his trademark:

• He gets a $2-3 breakfast from McDonald's every morning
• He drives himself around in a $45K Cadillac
• He uses a flip phone

The big lesson about his brand?

-

Each of these choices reinforces his image as the "Oracle of Omaha".

He's an authentic, down-to-earth man who represents humility.

But don't mistake this for lack of branding savvy.

Buffett understands the power of personal brand better than most...

-

"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."

Buffett's brand isn't built on flash, but on trust.

His annual shareholder letters are a masterclass in transparent communication:

-

He admits mistakes openly: "I've made lots of dumb decisions. That's part of the game."

This honesty strengthens his credibility.

The Buffett brand extends beyond finance:

-

• His political endorsements carry weight
• His folksy wisdom makes complex topics accessible
• His pledges to donate 99% of his wealth inspire philanthropy

All because people trust his judgment.

Buffett's approach contradicts typical personal branding advice:

-

• No fancy suits
• No flashy lifestyle
• No social media presence

Yet his brand is one of the most valuable in the world.

The lesson? Authenticity trumps artifice.

Buffett's brand power is measurable:

-

When he endorses a company, its stock typically jumps above normal market movement.

Sure: Often, this is because of his track record. But the "Buffett Bump" is worth billions.

People trust his word.

The counterintuitive branding lesson?

-

If you want to build a brand, base it around your personality.

Buffett's brand is valuable because it's genuine: It's not a façade, but a reflection of who he is.

And it's an important reminder:

-

A personal brand is more lucrative than ever.

Buffett's has provided billions of value:

Investors know he's honest. People bring him deals because they trust him. Companies love his management style.

You'll never regret building a personal brand.

Thread 9 - Japan

This is crazy.

Japanese people never get sick & live to 100+ while:

• Barely exercising
• Drinking & smoking
• Eating tons of carbs

But when Americans do it? They get obese & burn out.

I had to find out the truth... 🧵

-

The differences in health are remarkable.

Japan:

• Have a life expectancy ~8 years more than the US
• Spend around half as much on healthcare
• Are around 10x less obese

It's astounding.

But on the surface, they don't seem that healthy...

How do they do it?

-

It starts with a concept called "Hara Hachi Bu".

This 2500-year-old Confucian teaching instructs people to eat until they're 80% full.

But it's more than just portion control...

It's about mindful eating and listening to your body.

The result?

-

Japanese people consume about 25% fewer calories than Americans.

Yet they feel more satisfied after meals.

Why? Because they're not just eating less...

They're eating better.

Let's break down the Japanese diet:

-

1. Fermented foods

Miso, natto, pickled vegetables...

These aren't just tasty. They're probiotic powerhouses.

Studies show fermented foods can:

• Boost immune function
• Improve digestion
• Fight depression

But there's more to it than just gut health...

-

2. Green tea

The average Japanese person drinks 5 cups a day.

It's loaded with "catechins", antioxidants that:

• Boost metabolism
• Reduce inflammation
• Protect against cancer

But here's the real kicker:

-

Green tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness.

This might explain why Japanese people can smoke and drink, yet still seem less stressed.

Speaking of stress...

-

3. "Ikigai"

This Japanese concept roughly translates to "reason for being".

It's about finding purpose in life, no matter how small.

Studies show people with a strong sense of purpose live longer and healthier lives.

But how does this translate to everyday life?

-

In Japan, retirement isn't the end goal.

Many people work well into their 80s and 90s, not out of necessity, but choice.

They stay engaged, contributing to society.

This leads to better cognitive health and lower rates of depression.

But what about exercise?

-

4. "Incidental exercise"

Japanese cities are designed for walking and cycling.

The average Tokyo resident walks 7km a day!

This isn't intense cardio, but consistent, low-impact movement.

It keeps metabolism high without stressing the body.

There's one more crucial factor...

-

5. Social connections

Japan has a strong culture of community and family ties.

Regular social interactions reduce stress, boost immune function, and promote longevity.

In fact, Okinawa (home to many centenarians) has a tradition called "moai"...

-

Moai are social support groups that last for life.

Members meet regularly, providing emotional and even financial support.

This sense of belonging and purpose is a powerful antidote to the isolation many face in modern societies.

So, what can we learn from all this?

-

The Japanese secret to longevity isn't about strict diets or intense workouts.

It's about balance, mindfulness, and community.

And the best part? We can all incorporate these principles, starting today.

thread 10 - Chamath

The billionaire VC who scaled Facebook to 1 Billion users:

Chamath Palihapitiya.

He recently declared “Social media is dead.”

His 5 shocking predictions on the future of social media (and how you can take advantage):

-

The root problem affecting social networks isn't technical—it's psychological.

@chamath
believes that people have lost belief in themselves, leading to a surge in anger and toxicity online.

What does this mean for social media?

-

"The real problem is a psychological one that we're dealing with. People through a whole set of situations have lost belief in themselves."

This lack of self-belief manifests as negativity, making social networks unusable for millions.

Take Twitter...

But there's a solution:

-

Attaching a social cost.

We can hold people accountable by leveraging:

1. Real-world identity, so there are reputational consequences for negative users
2. Economic frameworks where toxicity has a monetary price

But there's a bigger shift on the horizon:

-

With AI, it’s possible to personalize algorithms.

An AI system with strong social/emotional intelligence could help mediate interactions.

It’d detect toxic patterns and intervene to de-escalate—like a skilled moderator:

-

Imagine AI that understands your emotional context and curates content to suit your mood, while avoiding the spiral of negativity.

This is the potential of AI in social media.

And there's a reason why this trend might accelerate:

-

Since costs are plummeting for both computing power and energy, abundant and cheap resources will let platforms test new social experiences at an unprecedented pace.

Another major shift we're seeing?

-

The rise of the individual creator.

Creators can provide curated communities and customized content feeds to their audience.

Take MrBeast for example - he's approaching 1B+ viewers.

Content creators are the natural evolution of social media:

-

They are the new atomic unit in the space.

Much like how social apps captured value from platforms, creators can harness massive reach and engagement for their own ends.

And in another 10 years, there’ll be dozens more like Mr Beast.

The implications for social media?

-

Individual creators will continue accruing power in the social landscape.

Because of this, the social networks that endure will be those that empower creators.

This is the future of decentralized media.

But getting there requires fixing core issues—beyond just the technical:

-

Again, it all comes back to the psychological. Take Twitter as an example:

Simply promoting free speech isn't enough if it makes the experience toxic for most users.

There needs to be a balance—a social cost to keep things in check.

-

Much like a town square, what if inflammatory speech came with a literal price tag?

Those who want to promote controversial views would have to pay for the privilege.

This will create a natural break on incendiary content without resorting to heavy-handed censorship.

-

Another solution is to tier access based on reputation.

Users who consistently add value could earn more voice while those who don’t face restrictions.

This will foster an economy of social capital based on trust.

Regardless, social media needs to change its tune:

-

Out with “move fast and break things”, and in with responsible innovation.

Scale and disruption can’t be chased at the expense of everything else.

Platforms need to be optimized for people to flourish.

That means solving issues like:

-

• Algorithmic bias
• Filter bubbles
• Attention hijacking
• Mental health impact

"When an industry becomes critical, you have to slow down."

-

One thing is clear.

Social media is the nervous system of the 21st century.

The future will be defined by the health of our information ecosystem.

The next generation of social media will require careful, methodical innovation to get it right.

Thread 11 - Goobie

An MIT neurosurgeon has gone viral for quitting his job & going to the mountains alone.

He realized our health system isn't designed to help you get better.

It's only designed to exploit you for your money.

It's a devastating story — this is the shocking truth he discovered:

-

4 years at MIT.
6 years of neurosurgery training.
10 years as a practicing neurosurgeon.
20 years of his life dedicated to medicine.

Yet he walked away from it all last year.

What could be so bad you quit something you've devoted your life to?

-

It started with a simple oath in medical school:

"Your job as doctors is to relieve suffering."

Note: Not just surgery & pills.

Sometimes, relieving suffering means just listening & acknowledging what someone's going through.

Keep this in mind — it'll be important later on.

-

Goobie had always been fascinated by the brain.

Unfortunately, he hit a wall in his research & pivoted to spine surgery.

But this is where things started to go wrong...

-

Despite:

• Being paid well
• Having a prestigious job
• Great colleagues & support

He felt deeply unhappy. But he had no idea why.

Until he remembered his oath from medical school...

-

He noticed a puzzling pattern in his patients:

• Many got better without intervention
• Some patients healed before he could operate
• Others never improved, despite perfect surgeries

And it saddened him — because he couldn't reliably relieve suffering.

What was he missing?

-

To find answers, he started asking patients everything:

• What's your job?
• Are you stressed?
• How well do you sleep?
• What do you eat and drink?
• Do you smoke or use drugs?

And a clear pattern emerged:

-

The patients who healed fastest shared common traits:

• No smoking, minimal drinking
• Mostly plant-based diet
• Strong social support
• Regular sweating
• Low stress levels
• 8 hours of sleep

And this led to his 'aha' moment:

-

When your body heals, it doesn't just fix one part.

It heals everything — joints, skin, digestive tract... They heal in tandem.

Figuring out how people heal might seem like a positive discovery.

But there's a sinister side to this:

-

Our health system is not set up for positive lifestyles.

Think about it:

If everyone ate well, exercised & didn't drink/smoke, surgeries would plummet. Hospitals would lose money.

The very people who are meant to help you get better BENEFIT from you not getting better.

-

And this is why Dr Goobie quit.

He'd taken an oath years ago to relieve suffering.

But medicine's focus was in surgeries, pills and imaging procedures. Anything you can make money from.

And this tore him apart. He couldn't do this for the rest of his life...

-

Dr Goobie's living happily in the mountains now.

But the problem he highlighted still stands: Our health system is corrupt & broken.

The US spends the most on healthcare (by a significant margin) — and yet:

-

US life expectancy at birth is three years lower than the OECD average.

Avoidable deaths per 100,000 population in the U.S. are higher than the OECD average too.

How can this be?

-

In the US, incentives are so deeply misaligned that your sickness is being profited off.

Big Food & Big Tech will keep making you unhealthier. Big Pharma will keep profiting off your illnesses.

Everyone wins — apart from you.

The US is the only high-income country to do this:

-

Who's behind this?

For one, the medley of huge businesses that profit from sickness.

• 4 private health insurers account for 50% of all enrolments
• 4 pharma giants generate 60% of America’s drug revenues

A for-profit healthcare system was supposed to bring low prices...

-

But the opposite happened, and these huge companies get bigger & bigger.

For example:

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 limited the profits of health insurers to between 15% and 20% of collected premiums.

Sounds like a good thing, right?

-

But health insurers played the game.

The law didn't restrict what e.g. physicians can earn. So insurers started buying up clinics, pharmacies and the like.

Then, they steer customers to THEIR OWN clinics & pharmacies rather than rival providers.

See how deep this goes?

-

Taking down these companies is not a battle we'll win in our lifetime.

The power & political ties of these big companies will continue to prioritize profits over people.

The only solution?

-

Follow Dr Goobie's advice.

Eat healthy. Exercise. Sleep well. Foster your relationships.

Each aspect of your health will improve together.

The big companies want you to get sick so they can profit. Don't fall into their trap.

Invest in prevention. It's your only protection.

Thread 12 - PBD

Recognize this guy?

He couldn't speak English. Was a child refugee. Came from war-torn Iran.

Today, he has a billion-dollar empire and 3.7M YouTube subscribers.

If you want to get ridiculously rich, study his story:

-

Born in Tehran in 1978, Bet-David's family fled Iran during the Islamic Revolution.

They spent 2 years in a refugee camp, where PBD first tasted hustle: cleaning up 5,000 beer bottles to earn $150.

They arrived in the US in 1990. Patrick spoke no English. How would they get by?

-

PBD then barely scraped through high school with a 1.8 GPA.

His solution?

Join the 101st Airborne Division - a move to reset his life trajectory and gain leadership skills.

Post-military, PBD aimed for Hollywood - until a girlfriend at an investment bank changed his path...

-

He landed at Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor. He was just 21.

But he soon realized it wasn't his calling, and founded PHP Agency:

An insurance marketing organization with a mission to serve the middle class.

How did the biz do?

-

PHP Agency grew from 66 agents in one office to over 14,000 across nearly all 50 states.

The secret to its growth?

How PBD hired and trained his employees:

-

He recruited agents who had ambition - but lacked formal education/backgrounds in finance.

Then, he developed a bulletproof training program to get them up to speed.

Financial literacy, sales, client management. You name it.

The diamonds in the rough just needed polishing...

-

Crucially, he incentivized his agents to recruit others - offering commissions not only on their sales but on the sales of their recruits.

The company also recognized and rewarded top performers.

With an environment like this, it's hard for a company not to succeed…

-

But PBD wasn't satisfied with business success - he wanted to share his knowledge and inspire others.

Enter Valuetainment:

-

Valuetainment is a media company and YouTube channel focused on entrepreneurship education.

And I love when entrepreneurs take the leap and spread their wisdom:.

Anyone can be an entrepreneur. Problem is, it's a super uncertain path.

We need people like PBD to pave the way...

-

PBD's authentic storytelling and consistent, high-quality content resonated with viewers.

He once got Kobe Bryant to break down his business philosophy for 45 minutes.

His trick? Deep research + unexpected questions + creating a "safe space" for candid answers.

Plus:

-

PBD's brand is built on 3 pillars:

1. Diverse topics: business, politics, sports - you name it.
2. High-profile guests: Everyone from George Bush to Mark Cuban.
3. Controversy: PBD's never afraid to challenge mainstream narratives.

Similar to what's made Joe Rogan successful...

-

PBD's since expanded his empire goes beyond YouTube:

• Investor: Recently acquired a minority stake in the NY Yankees
• Bestselling author: "Your Next Five Moves" hit #1 on WSJ's list
• Podcaster: The PBD Podcast has 1.77M subscribers

His estimated net worth? $200 million.

-

I've taken a bunch of things from PBD's story:

1. Be yourself. People love PBD for his own views, however controversial they may be.

He invites people from all sides of an argument to the table and never shies away from asking the tough questions.

-

2. Add value.

PBD's fame accelerated once he started giving back to his audience. He turned his success into the success of millions.

Ultimately, these two things - being yourself and adding value - are the foundations of every killer personal brand.


Thread 13 - Balaji

The man who can predict the future:

Balaji.

He was an early investor in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Eight Sleep.

He just said, "Social media is about to become far, far more lucrative than people realize."

His 4 shocking predictions on the future of social media & wealth creation:

-

1. Influencers = Engineers

Balaji thinks we're not even CLOSE to the peak of social media's power.

In fact, we're just getting started.

And anyone who wants to build wealth needs to realize:

-

"Anyone who wants to build billion-dollar companies will have to also build a million-person media following.

Every new company could have a founding influencer on par with a founding engineer."

What does this mean for you?

-

Attention is today's currency.

And unlike any other time in history, ANYONE can make it.

You don't need to have specialized skills to build a company - a huge following is as valuable as a decade of coding experience.

But it's gets even bigger:

-

2. Every Company is a Media Company

Balaji coins the term "dollowers":

Most followers today are non-paying & non-engaged.

But "dollowers" are "dollar-weighted" followers: They are engaged AND pay creators.

Why's this so important?

-

Unlike following, "dollowing" is a scarce & valuable behavior.

It signifies commitment to a cause - and we're already seeing this on platforms like Substack & Patreon.

These platforms are bringing generational changes in social media:

-

On these platforms, creators build a following that's both engaged and monetized.

And these creators are becoming the most powerful figures.

Their work earns attention AND capital (vs just one of the two).

Social media will become a medium for change. Balaji says:

-

"We may not get life extension or brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy unless you, personally, evangelize them online."

But the importance of social media doesn't end there.

In fact, it will impact how our ENTIRE society functions:

-

3. The Rise of "Network States"

Balaji predicts the emergence of 'network states':

These are digital communities that evolve into real-world entities - almost like their own political states.

Bear with me here:

-

We're seeing online communities become stronger & more cohesive by the day:

• Creators are building cult-like followings
• Groups are coming together to support causes
• What happens online is translating to the real world

Now take this one step further:

-

Balaji imagines states where laws are code, voting's on the blockchain & meritocracy's built in.

These states will spawn from e.g. subreddits you're part of today.

Citizenship's not determined by where you're born - but what you believe in.

Here, we'll see the next prediction:

-

4. The "Pseudonymous Economy'

Balaji predicts we'll soon operate under digital pseudonyms, separating our online and official identities.

Just like you're a character in video games, you get to be someone else online.

The "pseudonymous economy" is driven by three key factors:

-

• Tech platforms support multiple accounts
• New laws discouraging the collection of personal data
• Crypto means we can conduct business without revealing identities

Separating one's "speaking name" from their "official name" brings a host of benefits:

-

With "pseudonymous identities", content creation becomes free.

"Pseudonymity defends against social supply chain disruptions. Your key investor, employee or customer can't go south on you as easily if what's being denounced is a pseudonym".

All this means one thing:

-

Building a following will become the best investment of the next century.

Pseudonymous identities mean a following is an asset:

It will continue to compound - like this generation's equivalent of real estate.

Pay rent, or build wealth.

To me, the choice seems clear.

Thread 14 - YouTube

These kids sold a video-sharing website for $1.65 billion in 2006.

Then vanished overnight.

Today, that site is worth over $455 BILLION dollars.

Here's why they walked away from the most valuable website in history:

-

These unknown kids have shaped your life forever.

And you've never heard their names.

Meet Chad, Steve, and Jawed: the founders of YouTube.

3 friends who stumbled into creating the world's 2nd largest search engine.

And their journey? It's wilder than any viral video:

-

It all started with a dinner party in 2004.

Frustrated they couldn't share videos easily, they had an idea...

A video dating site. "Tune in, Hook up" was its tagline.

Thankfully, it bombed.

But their next idea changed entertainment forever:

-

YouTube launched from a garage in February 2005.

No fancy offices. No big investors. Just 3 guys with a simple mission:

The first upload? 18 seconds of Jawed at the zoo.

"The elephants have really, really long trunks."

Not exactly viral content. But it lit a fuse...

-

YouTube's growth was incredible:

• 100 million daily views
• 65,000 daily uploads

It went from a garage project to a cultural phenomenon in just a year.

Their next move would reshape media forever:

-

YouTube made billion-dollar deals with big media companies.

This changed how content was shared. Everyone wanted to be part of it.

Old media rushed to keep up as YouTube changed everything.

But this was just the start. Something even bigger was coming:

-

October 2006: Google acquires YouTube for $1.65 billion.

The founders became instant tech royalty.

Most would've basked in the spotlight, building personal empires.

Not these guys. They saw something we didn't:

-

YouTube wasn't just a website. It was a cultural shift.

• It launched Justin Bieber
• Spawned a $15 billion creator economy
• Revolutionized how we consume news and information

It had seemed their creation had outgrown them.

So they did the unthinkable...

-

By 2011, all 3 founders had walked away from YouTube.

They abandoned the internet's most powerful platform at its peak.

Why? Because true innovators don't rest on their laurels.

They build, disrupt, and then move on to the next big challenge...

-

Post-YouTube, they didn't disappear. They evolved:

• Hurley invested in the Golden State Warriors, turning them into NBA champs
• Chen backed unicorns like Slack and Airbnb
• Karim's investments included Reddit and Palantir

But their greatest legacy lives on...

-

YouTube today is a behemoth:

• 2.6 billion active users (1/3 of the internet)
• $28.8 billion in revenue in 2021

But these numbers only scratch the surface. The real power of YouTube?

-

It's not just video sharing. It's a force that reshapes our world:

• Influences elections (62% of US adults get news from it)
• Drives social movements (#MeToo videos: 32M views in 2017)

From entertainment to revolution, YouTube's impact is undeniable.

The lesson?

-

World-changing ideas often start with solving a simple problem.

Chad, Steve, and Jawed just wanted to share party videos.

Now, their creation shapes global politics, culture, and commerce.

What's the YouTube of tomorrow? Are you building it?

The stage is set. Your move.




Thread 15 - Burger King

In 2018, Burger King pulled off the biggest heist in food history.

They stole millions of McDonald's customers using one sneaky trick.

The result? 1.5 Million app downloads in 9 days.

Here's how they did it:

-

In 2018, Burger King was in a pickle.

McDonald's had 14,000 US locations. Burger King? Just 7,000.

They couldn't compete on convenience. So they decided to compete on creativity.

Enter "The Whopper Detour campaign":

-

The concept was simple, yet brilliant:

Offer a 1-cent Whopper to anyone within 600 feet of a McDonald's.

But here's the twist: customers had to order through the BK app.

Burger King spent a year developing this technology:

-

It was no mean feat:

• Geofencing all 14,000 McDonald's locations
• Ensuring the app could handle massive traffic
• Creating a mobile ordering system from scratch

But the payoff was worth every penny…

-

On December 4, 2018, the campaign launched.

Social media exploded. News outlets picked up the story.

People were driving to McDonald's... to order Burger King.

It wasn't just marketing. It was performance art.

And by the end of the campaign?

-

The results were staggering:

• 50 million views on Twitter alone
• 1.5 million app downloads in 9 days
• 3.3 billion earned media impressions
• BK app jumps from #686 to #1 in App Store

Burger King had turned McDonald's biggest strength into a weakness.

-

But it wasn't just about the numbers.

The campaign showcased Burger King's brand personality:

• Clever
• Irreverent
• Willing to take risks

They weren't just selling burgers. They were selling an attitude.

-

The marketing world took notice:

• Grand Clio at Clio Awards
• Best of Show at One Show
• Grand Prix at Cannes Lions

Burger King had created more than an ad. They'd created a cultural moment.

-

The long-term impact?

• Stronger brand loyalty
• A new playbook for digital marketing
• Increased app usage and mobile orders

Burger King proved:

No matter who you're competing with, in the digital age, creativity can level the playing field…

-

And this isn't just about big brands.

The same principles apply universally to whatever you're building:

Blindly spending on traditional marketing is foolish. Instead, embrace creativity.

Think about how you can generate maximum, long-lasting impact without spending millions:

-

If you're a founder today trying to grow your business, you need to embrace unconventional methods.

Traditional marketing is getting expensive + ineffective.

The future is organic.

So we've spent the last 1.5 years perfecting a new way to get your vision out into the world…

-

And this is why this story resonated with me.

We've helped countless founders beat the large incumbents who are set in their ways.

Instead of pumping money into traditional marketing, these founders are building personal brands. Creating authentic content.

Why?

-

Because today's people buy from people.

We've seen Logan Paul sell energy drinks. Charli D'Amelio sell mattresses. MrBeast sell chocolate.

They created content first, let people get familiar with them and took advantage of that.

You need to do the same:

-

Creating content is this generation's real estate.

If you're a founder, it creates an asset that pays dividends for life.

You can use it to attract customers, investors, business partners, and opportunities... on autopilot.

It's this generation's Burger King masterclass.

Thread 16 - Focus Playlist

"How to finish more work in 2 hours than 95% of people do in 2 weeks: 

Create a focus playlist.

Try these soundtracks:

• Drive

• Dune

• TENET

• Dunkirk

• Ad Astra

• Inception

• Interstellar

• The Batman

• Cyberpunk 2077

• Blade Runner 2049

• The Dark Knight Trilogy

Your brain will get into deep work 2x faster. 

Prime yourself.

Prepare your mind for the activity.

8 hours of sleep primes you to focus.

30 minutes of reading primes you to write.

10 minutes of planning primes you to organize.

Short-term preparation leads to long-term success. 

Schedule deep work sessions for 1.5 to 2 hours.

Why?

1) It takes 20-30 minutes to get into flow state

2) It takes around 1.5-2 hours before your focus declines

Take a break too early, you won’t get into flow.

But if you don't take a break, you'll work inefficiently. 

Separate tasks based on their type.

Batch analytical tasks together:

• Organization

• Research

• Planning

Batch creative tasks together:

• Writing

• Designing

• Brainstorming

Your brain wastes energy to adjust when you switch from task to task. 

Remove distractions.

Too much noise?

Use noise-cancelling earbuds.

Distracting websites?

Use a website/app blocker.

Too much going at home?

Go to a coffee shop.

It's impossible to get distracted when it's not an option. 

Set 1 goal for each work block.

Break it into 3 actionable tasks.

Now, focus on 1 task at a time.

When you complete it, move to the next.

Knowing what you need to do prevents you from getting distracted with “busy” work. 

Reflect.

After your work sessions, look at what you can improve.

Do you need to:

• Change the length of time?

• Do certain tasks before others?

• Work at a different part of the day?

Optimize for the next session. 

Reward yourself.

Do something fun after your work session.

Watch Netflix, go on Twitter, play a video game.

This makes your brain associate positive feelings with work.

Next time you go to work it'll be 10x easier. 

How to finish more work in 2 hours than 95% of people do in 2 weeks:

1. Create a focus playlist

2. Prime yourself

3. Work for 1.5 - 2 hours

4. Separate analytical and creative tasks

5. Remove distractions

6. Set 1 goal for each work block

7. Reflect

8. Reward yourself

Thread 18 - LeBron's investments

"LeBron James is the NBA's first billion-dollar man.

He's earned $346M from NBA contracts and $700M from his off-court deals.

THREAD: LeBron's 7 best investments. 

1. Nike

At the age of 18, a kid from Akron turned down a $10M check from Reebok.

• "I started thinking... if he's willing to give me a $10M check now, what if Nike or Adidas is willing to give me 20?"

A few months later, LeBron signed with Nike for $90M. 

2. Beats

Prior to launch in 2008, Beats sent LeBron 15 pairs.

When the US Olympic team arrived in Paris wearing Beats, the photos went viral.

Beats’ first release sold out shortly after.

As a “silent investor,” LeBron made $30M when Apple acquired Beats in 2016.

3. Liverpool FC

LeBron invested $6.5M for 2% of Liverpool in 2011. Since:

• 1x Champions League title

• 1x Premier League title

Now, that 2% stake is worth $80M.

But… 

3a. In March 2021, LeBron parlayed the Liverpool stake into an ownership board role at Fenway Sports Group.

FSG is the parent company of:

• Liverpool

• Roush Racing

• Boston Red Sox

If LeBron wants to be an NBA owner someday, FSG is the vehicle to make it happen. 

4. Blaze Pizza

LeBron invested <$1M in 2012 for 10%. Revenue since:

• ‘12: $800K

• ‘17: $280M

• ‘19: $366M

In 2017, the initial investment was reportedly worth $35M.

Now? Much closer to $70M.

In addition to the equity, LeBron owns 19 Blaze franchises across the US.

5. Uninterrupted

Backed by more than $15M in investment in 2014, the media venture got off the ground quickly.

It produces:

• The Shop (HBO)

• Shut Up & Dribble

• Kneading Dough

Now, Uninterrupted rolls into a new venture of LeBron's… 

6. SpringHill Entertainment

LeBron founded SpringHill Entertainment in 2020. The company's been on a tear:

• Space Jam 2 ($135M box office, $75M merch)

• Naomi Osaka docuseries (Netflix)

Nike was rumored to be interested in acquiring the company at a $750M valuation. 

7. Lobos 1707

LeBron invested in Lobos 1707 tequila in 2020.

On his decision:

• “If it tastes great in Akron, Ohio, then I know it’s the right thing.”

• “I had to make sure it wasn’t the boat in Italy getting to me.”

Plus, LeBron brings it courtside 😂

Bonus: I Promise

LeBron founded the “I Promise” program in Akron, Ohio in 2011.

This past June, the program’s inaugural class of 133 graduated high school.

Each student was offered free tuition to Kent State or Akron University. 

I Promise (cont)

The program was so successful, LeBron founded the “I Promise” school in 2018.

• 1,300 students

• Each guaranteed a college scholarship if they do their part

With this investment, LeBron is changing lives in his hometown.

All this can't happen without LeBron's business team.

• Maverick Carter

• Rich Paul

• Randy Mims

Legends in their own right.

Thread 19 - No Code Building

"I’ve done over $1M in income in 2 years as an entrepreneur.

And I didn't write a single line of code.

My 12 "must use" no-code tools:

[🧵 thread} 

1/ Carrd

@carrd is the fastest and easiest way to build websites.

It's great for personal sites or standing up landing pages quickly.

I use it for nearly everything I do because it makes getting started extremely simple. 

2/ Gumroad

For digital products, nothing is easier and faster than @gumroad

I can think of a product/service and have it fully embedded on my Carrd landing page in less than 10 minutes.

This lets me start pre-selling fast to get the validation I need to continue. 

3/ Canva

@canva has made me into my own personal graphic designer.

Whether it's Twitter banners, icons, logos, landing page graphics, Instagram posts, you name it...

Canva makes it as easy as drag-and-drop to start designing. 

4/ Outseta

Thinking about launching a community or SaaS product?

@outseta is your tool.

A CRM, payments, subscriptions, email automation, gated content, segmentation, etc...

Outseta is loaded with great features and functionality at an extremely fair price. 

5/ AirTable

@airtable keeps my entire advising business thriving and organized.

Collecting information through forms, automating email triggers, building Kanban charts, and collaborating with my wife are just some of the things I love doing to manage my business. 

6/ Calendly

@Calendly means I don't need a VA for scheduling, nor do I need any time-consuming back and forth.

Anything that requires scheduling a meeting, a simple Calendly embed works wonders.

I also drop it on my website for paid coaching calls. 

7/ Fathom Analytics

Looking at Google Analytics can be confusing for some folks.

@usefathom is simple, privacy-first, cookie-free, and GDPR compliant.

Plus, with just a glance, I know exactly what is impacting my website traffic.

Great service. 

8/ Loom

@loom is my favorite tool for:

- Building video process docs

- Building out my online courses

- Doing video walkthroughs for my community

- Teaching someone how a piece of software works

Simple, easy to install, and tracks visitor/watcher analytics. 

9/ Testimonial.to

Strong testimonials are a great way to improve conversion.

Nothing makes it easier and more impactful than testimonial.to

I embed it in my course, and users can leave video/text testimonials that automatically appear on my landing pages. 

Testimonial - Collect and embed testimonials in minutes

With Testimonial, in minutes, you can collect and display video testimonials and other types of testimonials from your customers with no need for a developer or website hosting.

10/ HypeFury

@Yannick_Veys added new features that have recently turned it from good to "I can't live without this".

Scheduling Tweets, crafting threads, being inspired, sending to other social media, running sales...

It does everything for the content writer.

A must-buy. 

11/ Notion

@NotionHQ is basically the master hub for my whole life. In Notion I:

- Host my roadmap

- Manage my to-do list

- Write all of my content

- Store my process docs

- And much more...

And I'm still learning how to use it most effectively. 

12/ Zapier

No list would be complete without @zapier

Never has one tool made me feel like the whole world of technology is at my fingertips.

From building simple pass-through Zaps, to complex, multi-step Zaps, Zapier makes anything possible by combining technologies. 

Well, that's all for today.

Thread 20 - Job at Microsoft

"I applied to 300+ jobs in 2013.

Got rejected from all of them.

Two years later, I was in final rounds at Microsoft, Google, & Twitter.

The result?

An offer from Microsoft with a $70k+ raise.

Here’s a🧵 with the 9 steps I used to make it happen. ↓ 

1/ Understand Who Companies Really Hire

I used to think the most qualified candidate got the job.

That's not true.

Companies don't hire the most qualified candidate.

They hire the person they believe will deliver the most value.

My new goal?

Be that person. 

2/ Choose 15 Target Companies

To illustrate value, I had to narrow my focus.

I stopped applying to random jobs online.

Instead, I made a list of 15 target companies.

Then I aimed to learn everything I could about:

- Their goals

- Their challenges

- Their major initiatives 

3/ Find 150 Prospects

I knew I needed a referral.

An internal advocate would help me skip the line and maximize my value.

So I made a list of 10 contacts at each company.

I aimed for potential hiring managers and teammates.

10 contacts * 15 companies = 150 total contacts. 

4/ Start Making Contact

I didn't ask for a referral up front.

I made my initial outreach about the other person:

- I engaged with their content

- Recognized career transitions

- Asked for advice and followed up with results

After a few touch points, I asked for a call. 

5/ Identify Opportunities For Value

I used these calls to perform discovery.

I'd ask my contacts about:

- Their journeys

- The biggest challenge their team is facing

- The six month goals for their team

I'd look for any opportunity where I could illustrate tangible value. 

6/ Research, Research, Research

With my potential opportunity in hand, I'd start researching.

My favorite tactics were:

- Surveying customers / prospects

- Performing competitive analyses

- Gathering credible industry data

Then I'd prepare my pitch. 

7/ Crafting A Pitch Deck

I packaged my pitch in a short slide deck:

I introduced the problem / opportunity.

I backed it up with industry data.

I shared 2-3 ideas or solutions with an execution plan.

Then I sent the deck to my contact and asked for a referral. 

8/ Examples of Ideas

For Google, I created a personalized pitch strategy for a potential client.

For Twitter, I shared 5 ideas for monetizing their existing audience.

For Microsoft, I surveyed SMBs and turned the feedback into a strategy to help Microsoft Ads reach more SMBs. 

9/ Referral + Value = Opportunities

Now I was walking into interviews with 2 things:

1. A referral from an internal advocate

2. A clear, tangible illustration of my value that directly related to the company's goals

The focus was on that, not my non-traditional background. 

10/ Landing The Offer

At the end, Microsoft extended an offer.

I officially became a Partner Manager at Microsoft Ads.

That job took my total comp from $70k / year → $130k / year.

All without “traditional” experience and without applying online.

Thread 21 - Jeff Bezos

"With Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO, here’s a thread of the best things I’ve learned from him.

1. Be willing to change your mind.

As Bezos famously said: "Anybody who doesn’t change their mind a lot is dramatically underestimating the complexity of the world we live in.” 

2. There are two kinds of decisions.

One-way door decisions are irreversible, so make them slowly. Two-way door decisions are the opposite. Since you can go back on them, you should make them quickly.

Image

3. Encourage good writing

Amazon’s built a writing-first culture where employees review six-page memos at the start of important meetings. Writing takes longer in the short-term but saves time in the long-term. The memos are structured like a dissertation defense.

Here's how.

Image

4. Think analytically

Bezos thought analytically about everything, even women. Early in his career, he took ballroom dance classes to increase his exposure to what he called n+ women. Later, he called this “women flow.”

Source: The Everything Store 

5. Balance the efficiency you need to execute with the wandering you need to innovate.

Here's Bezos.

Image

6. Jeff Bezos is a serious micro-manager

Source: The Steve Yegge Google Platforms rant which is one of the best things ever written about Amazon.

gist.github.com/chitchcock/128…

Image

7. Keep things simple, even when your ideas are grand.

Amazon's principles are crisp and repeated often. That’s why he worked in an office building called “Day 1." True to his belief in simplicity, here's his rough original vision for Amazon Web Services.

Source: Steve Yegge

Image

8. If you do something ambitious, smart people will doubt you.

In 1997, Jeff Bezos spoke to a group of students at Harvard Business School. Now, he says: "If you want to be innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood, and criticized.”

(h/t @awealthofcs)

Image

9. Find structural advantages

Barnes & Noble thought they could out-compete Amazon because they had deeper pockets. But because Amazon only charged sales tax in Nevada and Washington, Barnes & Nobel had to offer deeper discounts to compete on price. 

10. Be customer-driven

There are negative book reviews on Amazon — even though publishers haven't historically wanted them because of Bezos' empathy for customers. He said: “We don’t make money when we sell something. We make money when we help someone make a purchase decision.” 

11. You will either fight to charge more or charge less.

Here's Bezos: “There are two kinds of retailers: there are those folks who work to figure how to charge more, and there are companies that work to figure how to charge less, and we are going to be the second, full-stop.” 

12. Start the product development process by writing a press release.

By writing a press release for each new product, employees have to compress their pitch down to its essence. Then, work backward from the customer's perspective and public perception.

https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1213575415991881728?s=20

13. Bezos focused on three core advantages: customer-centricity, long-term thinking, and a genuine love for invention.

This Harry Potter story is my favorite example because it shows how Amazon was willing to lose money in exchange for customer loyalty.

perell.com/essay/amazon/

Image

14. Build a flywheel

Jeff Bezos saw how flywheels could create compounding advantages for his company, long before they became common knowledge in the business world. Here's Amazon's flywheel in action, as drawn by @maxolson and explained by Bezos himself.

Image

Image

15. Follow a long-term vision, but know that things are going to change

“At Amazon, we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow and we’re very stubborn. We say we’re stubborn on vision and flexible on details.”

(h/t @BalesFootball) 

16. Sometimes, the best way to predict the future is to bet on things that won't change.

In Amazon's case, Bezos knows that customers will still want fast delivery, vast selection, and low prices ten years from now.

Image

17. Consider the regret minimization framework for hard decisions

"You want to have minimized the number of regrets you have. That's what should drive people. Not how much money they have. It's regrets that I think haunt people at the end of their life."

https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1307845738437713920?s=20

18. When the right opportunity comes, it's okay to sacrifice the short-term for the long-term.

Understanding the nature of software economics (with high fixed costs and low marginal costs), shaped Bezos' strategy for Amazon Web Services."

Thread 22 - Mental Models

"Mental models are the secret to making the best out of the world around you

But there is a million of them...

A guide to my favorite mental models: 

Marketing

Luck Surface Area:

“When you do something you’re excited about you will naturally pull others into your orbit.

The more people with whom you share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.”

Orbits are powerful in marketing, business or life 

Sales

Hunting whales vs flies:

5 types of sales prospects

1) Whales

2) Elephants

3) Deers

4) Rabbits

5) Flies

How can you hunt 1,000 whales, 10,000 elephants, 100,000 deers, 1,000,000 rabbits or 10,000,000 flies?

Who do you want to hunt? Why? 

(no animals were harmed writing that last tweet)

It's time for a non-hunting mental model for this

Any one have ideas? 

Military

Winning Hearts and Minds:

“In which one side seeks to prevail not by the use of superior force, but by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side.”

Key: if you speak to people's hearts and the minds, you are speaking to human nature 

Marketing

Compromise effect:

“A person is more likely to choose the middle option of a selection set rather than the extreme options”

Point: many startups live or die because or pricing

Price accordingly 

Strategy

Sustainable Competitive Advantage:

“Structural factors that allow a firm to outcompete its rivals for many years.”

Never lose sight of developing a stronger sustainable competitive advantage

Key word: sustainable 

Explanation

First principles thinking:

Think like a scientist. Start with questions like

1) What are we absolutely sure is true?

2) What has been proven?

Dig deep until you have uncovered undeniable truths about a situation 

Physics

Half life:

“The time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value."

-- What's the half-life of a tweet? Short and sweet

-- What's the half-life of your product? Hopefully long

Understanding half-life is undeniably important 

Brainstorming

Paradigm shift:

“A fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline.”

This term is overused (I know, I know) but is still an incredibly powerful concept 

Goodhart’s Law

Unroll available on Thread Reader

https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1398639350288637965

Brainstorming

Maslow’s hammer:

“If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”

Point: You are either a hammer, a nail or completely different 

Reasoning

Likely

"Thinking that just because something is possible means that it is likely"

Just because you think it might happen, doesn't mean it will

This induces fear & stress

It happens to me and probably happens to you

Good to keep an eye on it 

Negotiation

Active listening:

“Requires that the listener fully concentrates, understands, responds and then remembers what is being said.”

Point: the best negotiation tactic is to shut up and listen 

Military

Beachhead:

“A temporary line created when a military unit reaches a landing beach by sea and begins to defend the area while other reinforcements help out until a unit large enough to begin advancing has arrived.”

Every great startup begins as a beachhead 

Learning

Spacing Effect:

“The phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of time in a single session.”

Point: you don't need to read 52 books in 52 weeks 

Music

Coda:

“A term used in music primarily to designated a passage that brings a piece to an end.”

Great stories need an ending, some sort of call-to-action

That means your product, your landing page or your YouTube video
